# Research question
What is the average treatment effect of planting date on soybean yield

Step 1: 
a. Develop a DAG, verify the dag with the experts/colleagues
b. Identify the potential confounders that effect both planting date and yield

Step 2: Data
Source: NCSRPII data
Design: Survery, observed data

Step 3: Data cleaning and preprocessing
data format, handle missing values, outliers and other data quality issues

Step 4: Descriptive analysis of response variables and confounders

Step 5: Estimate treatment effect
Methods to use; linear regression, propensity score, TMLE, doubly robust

Step 6: Sensitivity Analysis

Step 7: Interpret results

Step 8: Draw conclusion

## questions for the group
Are there any missing links here?
If there are weather varaibles to consider, do those weather varialbes affect planting date?
