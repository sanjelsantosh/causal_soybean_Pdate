To convert 3.3 bushels per acre of soybeans to kg per hectare, we'll need to consider two factors:

Weight of a bushel of soybeans: 60 pounds per bushel.
Area conversion: convert acres to hectares. 1 acre = 0.404685642 hectares.

Convert bushels to kilograms: 3.3 bushels * 60 pounds/bushel = 198 pounds.
Convert pounds to kilograms: 198 pounds * 0.453592 kg/pound = 89.80 kg.
Convert acres to hectares: 1 acre * 0.404685642 hectares/acre = 0.404685642 hectares.
Divide kilograms by hectares to get kg/ha: 89.80 kg / 0.404685642 hectares = 222.13 kg/hectare.
Therefore, 3.3 bushels per acre of soybeans is equivalent to 222.13 kg per hectare.
