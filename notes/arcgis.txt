In my ArcGIS project, I have added a data points from a csv files. I have an existing layer of a map with us counties. I want to join the attribute table of the map to my csv data table. I have created a feature "PD" in the county attribute table and assigned "PD" values for each county in the map. Now I want to do the spatial join and add the PD coulum to my csv data. Each data of my csv has latitude and longitude value and they are correclty plotted over the county map. How do I do the spatial join so that I get the PD column in my csv which has the corrosponding "PD" value based on the county map layer/
